          Creating a game has been a passion project of mine for years, ever
          since I started programming in Java creating mods for Minecraft when I
          was 13. Through college I kept wanting to make some sort of video
          game, and now it's real. It's here. Thank you to everyone who gave me
          feedback and the others who helped make this possible.
